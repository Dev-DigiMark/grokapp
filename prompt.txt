Deal Information:
{deal_data}

Instructions:
Use the deal information and rules below to form a precise evaluation. Your report must include:
1. Deal Summary
- Provide a brief overview of the case, including:
    - Type of injury
    - Applicantâ€™s role in the incident
    - State or jurisdiction
    - Key documents available or missing
2. Rule-Based Evaluation
   Evaluate the deal based on the following rules:
    - If the injured party is listed first on the police ticket, they are likely at fault and the deal should be declined.
    - Check for availability of the following documents: TAR (Treatment Authorization Request), photos, ID, police report.
    - If the case is from Arizona and lacks TAR or police report, do not auto-decline.
    - If the applicant has a criminal record and litigation is involved, they may be disqualified as a witness, which increases the overall risk.
3. Risk Score Breakdown (0 to 100)
    - Assign a numerical risk score from 0 (no risk) to 100 (high risk).
    - Justify the score based on contributing risk factors.
4. Funding Cap Recommendation
    - Recommend a maximum funding amount.
    - Include a brief justification based on the risk profile, document availability, and case strength.
5. Final Decision
    - Clearly state whether the deal should be funded or declined.
    - Include a concise justification for the decision.
6. Rationale for Final Decision
    - Provide a detailed explanation of why the final decision was made.
